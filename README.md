As part of my Programming II module, I worked in pairs to apply Object Oriented Programming to develop a simple Ice Cream Management System. Some basic features I programmed includes displaying customer information, registering a new customer and creating a customer's order. An advanced feature I worked on is to display monthly charged amounts breakdown of a customer purchases & their total charged amounts for the year. 
Both the basic and advanced features I worked on are published here, so take a look at the respective files!
